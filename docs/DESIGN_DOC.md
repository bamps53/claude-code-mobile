## 4. Functional Design

### 4.1. SSH Connection Management

- **Objective**: To establish and manage secure connections to remote servers.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Support for both password and SSH key-based authentication.
  - Encrypted local storage for all connection credentials.
  - Monitor connection status and provide auto-reconnect capabilities.
  - Manage and store connection profiles for multiple servers.

### 4.2. `tmux` Session Management

- **Objective**: To manage `claude code` sessions running within `tmux` on the remote server.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - List active `tmux` sessions with metadata (e.g., creation time, last activity).
  - Create new sessions.
  - Attach to and detach from existing sessions.
  - Terminate (kill) sessions.
  - Real-time updates of session states.

### 4.3. Terminal Interface

- **Objective**: To provide a direct, interactive terminal for `claude code`.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Real-time command input and output display.
  - Full support for standard terminal escape sequences (colors, cursor movement).
  - Command history functionality.
  - Support for special key inputs (e.g., `Ctrl+C`, `Tab`, Arrow Keys).
  - User-configurable text size and color themes.

### 4.4. Push Notification System

- **Objective**: To provide asynchronous notifications for task completion.
- **Technical Design**:
  - **Server-Side**: A listener process on the server will monitor `tmux` output. It will trigger a notification upon detecting a specific signal, such as the BEL character (`\x07`).
  - **Push Delivery**: The server-side listener will use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification service (APNS) for iOS to deliver real-time push notifications.
  - **Client-Side**: The app will handle background notification reception and navigate the user to the relevant session upon opening (deep linking).

## 5. Security Design

### 5.1. Data Protection

- **Credentials**: All credentials (passwords, private keys) will be encrypted and stored locally using `Expo SecureStore`.
- **Data in Transit**: All communication will be encrypted using standard SSH cryptographic protocols.
- **Session Data**: Terminal output and session data will be held in-memory only and will not be persisted to disk on the mobile device.

### 5.2. Authentication Strategy

- **Primary Authentication**: SSH protocol (password or public key).
- **Secondary Authentication**: App-level security via PIN or Biometrics (`Face ID`/`Touch ID`) to unlock the application, implemented with `Expo Local Authentication`.
- **Session Inactivity**: The app will feature a configurable auto-timeout setting that locks the app after a period of inactivity.

## 6. Development & Debugging Workflow

To ensure an easy and effective debugging experience on real devices, we will use **Development Builds**.

1.  **Setup (One-time)**: Create a development-specific build of the app using the command `eas build --profile development` and install the resulting `.ipa`/`.apk` file on a physical device.
2.  **Daily Workflow**:
    - Run the development server on the local machine with `npx expo start --dev-client`.
    - Open the installed development app on the device. It will connect to the development server.
3.  **Debugging**: Use the **Flipper** desktop application. It will automatically connect to the running development build and provide powerful, out-of-the-box tools for inspecting the UI, logs, state, crashes, and more. **This is the recommended workflow for all debugging.**
