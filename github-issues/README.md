## Total Estimated Effort
**36-44 days** of testing implementation across all categories

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Unit Tests (SSH API, Redux Store, Custom Hooks)
2. **Phase 2**: Integration Tests (SSH Connection Flow)
3. **Phase 3**: Security Tests (Critical for production)
4. **Phase 4**: Platform-Specific Tests (iOS/Android)
5. **Phase 5**: Performance Tests & E2E Tests

## Testing Infrastructure Requirements
- Jest testing framework

- Detox for E2E testing
- Docker containers for SSH test servers
- Real iOS/Android devices
- Security testing tools
- Performance profiling tools

## Creating GitHub Issues
To create these issues in your GitHub repository:

1. Copy each `.md` file content to create a new GitHub issue
2. Use the suggested labels for each issue
3. Assign appropriate team members
4. Set milestones based on development phases
5. Link related issues where applicable
