# Claude Code Mobile

A React Native mobile client for remote SSH access to Claude Code sessions, designed for developers and system administrators who need secure mobile access to their servers.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Production-Ready Core Implementation** ✅  
**App Store Submission Phase** 🚧

- ✅ Native SSH implementation via `react-native-ssh-sftp`
- ✅ Direct server connections (no proxy required)
- ✅ Tmux session management
- ✅ Zero infrastructure costs for sustainable business model
- 🚧 EAS Build setup for production deployment

## 🏗 Architecture

**Tech Stack:**
- React Native 0.79.3 + Expo SDK 53
- TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Native Paper (Material Design)
- **Native SSH**: `@dylankenneally/react-native-ssh-sftp`

**Key Design Decision:** Native SSH over WebSocket proxy for production sustainability. See `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` for detailed rationale.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (Expo Go - UI development only)
npm start

# For SSH features, use EAS Development Build (coming soon)
```

**⚠️ Important**: SSH features require EAS Build due to native module dependencies. Expo Go only supports UI development.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Direct SSH connections** - No third-party servers
- **Local credential storage** - Uses Expo Secure Store
- **End-to-end encryption** - Standard SSH protocol
- **Private key support** - For enhanced security

## 💼 Business Model

**Zero Infrastructure Cost Architecture**
- Direct user-to-server connections
- No backend infrastructure required
- 99% profit margin potential
- Scalable without operational overhead

**Revenue Model:** Premium mobile app ($9.99-19.99) or subscription ($2.99/month)
