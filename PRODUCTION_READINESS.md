## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimate
```
Year 1: 1,000 users × $9.99 = $9,990 revenue
Operating costs: $0 (no infrastructure)
Net profit: $9,990 (99% margin)
```

### Optimistic Estimate  
```
Year 1: 5,000 users × $14.99 = $74,950 revenue
Year 2: 10,000 users × $14.99 = $149,900 revenue
Operating costs: $0 (no infrastructure)
Net profit: $224,850 (99% margin)
```

### Subscription Model Alternative
```
Monthly: 1,000 users × $2.99 = $2,990/month = $35,880/year
Annual growth: 50% user increase
Year 2: $53,820/year
Operating costs: $0 (no infrastructure)
```
