## Current Blockers & Questions

### Technical Decisions Needed
1. **SSH Library Choice**: Need to evaluate and choose between available React Native SSH libraries
2. **EAS Build Requirements**: Understand which native dependencies require EAS vs Expo Go
3. **Testing Strategy**: Decide on testing approach for SSH connectivity without real servers
4. **Notification Service**: Choose between self-hosted notification service vs cloud provider

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Research and test SSH libraries with Expo compatibility
2. Create proof-of-concept SSH connection in isolated branch
3. Set up testing environment with mock SSH server
4. Begin Expo Secure Store integration for credential storage
